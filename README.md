## Welcome to Guitar Center!
No Stairway.

The design document for this database schema can be found [here](https://sqlspy.io/import_db_designer/c3B5LTMyODkyNzQtMjA5ODgwNjQ2M2IzMWExMC01MDk2OTk=).

The purpose of this project is to practice CRUD functionality for a One-to-Many Relational Database in a web application according to MVC principles and navigating the RESTful routes.

In this case, the Parent Model is `Manufacturer` and the Child Model is `Guitar`.
